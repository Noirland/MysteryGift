== Requirements ==
- Run by Buycraft (console), only gives player as argument
- Must be weighted, ie chance of getting enderdragon skin extremely low
- Item gifts
  - Done through bukkit inventory methods
  - Randomisation of stack amount (for some only), from 1 stack to an entire inventory
  - Load data for items from config
  -
- Command gifts
  - Run as if console ran it
  - Commands will have blanks such as for player

TODO: Allow INV on amount

== Snippets ==
getServer().dispatchCommand(getServer().getConsoleSender(), "command");

for(int i=0; i<slots.size(); i++){
    if(getInventory().getSlot(i) == null){
        giveItem():
    }
}
